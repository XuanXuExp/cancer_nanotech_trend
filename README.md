<h2>Summary</h2>

A new way of providing potential opportunities for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy to investigate the comprehensive trends in cancer nanotechnology research. This paper applied the qualitative method of bibliometric analysis on cancer nanotechnology using the PubMed database during the years 2000â€“2021. It mined nearly 50,000 papers published in multiple reputed journals. The impact of our findings is significant, which focuses on hybrid medical models and content-based and bibliometric features for machine learning models in cancer detection, diagnosis, imaging, and therapy related to cancer nanotechnology in the world. We mainly identified and classified the top and significant keywords, countries, authors, affiliations, and research areas representing the documents in the top 100 journals in cancer nanotechnology, which will help researchers explore more powerful anticancer nanomedicines in the next five to ten years.

<h2>Python Code</h2>

1. Get PMID regarding the keywords
2. Extract information using IDs got previously
3. Save addresses and IDs
4. Connect PMID and address
5. Get GIS information
